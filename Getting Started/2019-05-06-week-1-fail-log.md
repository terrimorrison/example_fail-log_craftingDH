# Week 1 fail log
I have no idea what I'm doing!!!!!

There's a lot of stuff going on, and it's all very stressful. I feel like I'm forgetting something? 

## First Annotation

My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/8NgdlHH6EemyKIMFaG_6Yw/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was about trial and error for Hypothes.is. I have been using Opera as a browser since I got my laptop because Chrome had glitches with Windows 10 when I first got it, but Opera doesn't have as many things nice things as Chrome (like Hypothes.is, apparently) so for the duration of the class I'll be using Chrome. At least the glitch seems to be fixed! 

## Second Annotation

My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/IrCz1nToEemPohPRlHbBRQ/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was about annotations. I wondered if instead of asking the same question someone else asked, if I could refer to their annotation instead in my fail log and build off of it with my own ideas. I thought I saw something about it the other day, but I couldn't find it again. I was wondering about this because of [this annotation](https://hyp.is/FhDMDnDuEemuymfhkFAccA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) which was something I had been wondering myself. 

## Third Annotation

## Comments/Concerns
I still have no clue what the DH Box thing is, but I have an account ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
