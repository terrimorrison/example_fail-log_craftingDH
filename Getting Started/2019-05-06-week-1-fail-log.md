# Week 1 fail log
I have no idea what I'm doing!!!!!

There's a lot of stuff going on, and it's all very stressful. I feel like I'm forgetting something? 

## First Annotation

My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/8NgdlHH6EemyKIMFaG_6Yw/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was about trial and error for Hypothes.is. I have been using Opera as a browser since I got my laptop because Chrome had glitches with Windows 10 when I first got it, but Opera doesn't have as many things nice things as Chrome (like Hypothes.is, apparently). At least the glitch seems to be fixed!
